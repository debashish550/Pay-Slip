# Pay-Slip
Objective: Integrate Perfios API to retrieve payslip details in JSON format, focusing on backend implementation using Java Spring Boot. Implement checks to verify payslip authenticity, including validating ownership and checking the existence of the associate company. Utilize AWS S3 services for secure and efficient payslip upload and retrieval.

Technologies Used:

Java Spring Boot: Backend development framework.
Perfios API: Retrieve payslip details in JSON format.
AWS S3: Secure storage and retrieval of payslips.
Implementation Steps:

Perfios API Integration:
Use Perfios API to fetch payslip details in JSON format.
Backend Verification:
Validate payslip authenticity by verifying ownership.
Check the existence of the associate company.
AWS S3 Integration:
Implement secure upload and retrieval of payslips using AWS S3 services.
Components:

PayslipVerificationService: Service class to handle payslip verification logic, integrating Perfios API for data retrieval and implementing authenticity checks.
PayslipVerificationController: Controller class to handle incoming requests, calling the verification service and returning appropriate responses.
Result:

Authenticated Payslips: Payslips that pass authenticity checks are securely stored in AWS S3 and can be retrieved as needed.
Invalid Payslips: Payslips that do not pass verification are not stored, ensuring data integrity.
Note: Customize logic for verifying ownership and company existence according to specific project requirements. Implement error handling and security measures for a robust and secure system.
